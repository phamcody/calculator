The Odin Project Calculator Project // my attempt at recreating the apple iphone calculator app

I actually started this project on 4/7/2023 but due to some user error with GIT, I had to delete the repository and make a new one to uncomplicate the timeline and organization of this project.

I managed to copy and paste the HTML and CSS work I've coded prior to this reset and will paste them in this new repository. The timeline of the commits will not make sense and will be broader than usual.

RECAP: This project took alot longer than antipated. Not going to lie, I expected this project to be easy and shorter than the etch-a-sketch one but I was totally wrong. I mainly struggled with figuring out the logic of the calculator where I had to save each variable. That took me like 3 days to figure out. There are some quirky bugs that I have yet to figure out and maybe there's some more that I have not discovered yet but overall I feel as this is a complete project.
